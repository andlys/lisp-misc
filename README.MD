## Different scripts on ANSI Common Lisp 

Just some code I had fun with writing while learning the language.

Folders:
* interesting - may be worthy of attention
* programming-problems - may be worthy of attention
* basic - very basic and probably uninteresting

Code that demonstrates how concise and simple Lisp is. Techniques that simplify programming and that are missing in many other languages:  
`interesting/advantages.lisp`
